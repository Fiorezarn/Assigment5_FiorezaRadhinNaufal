# 🛠️ User Management Backend API

This project is a backend RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js, utilizing Sequelize ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database. The API manages user-related data, including Customers, their Addresses, Contacts, and Orders. The database schema consists of four main tables: `customers`, `addresses`, `contacts`, and `orders`, each with specific relationships and fields.
